In this blog post, I would like to share my notes as I go through the course. The course is based on the book [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527). Since the course does not include all the chapters of the book, I organized the notes and resources gathered from this course based on the book layout. I will update this post as I create new material.
