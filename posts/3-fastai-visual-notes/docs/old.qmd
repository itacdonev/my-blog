I feel like I am late to the fast.ai party, but, thinking positively, better be late than never even arrive. Generally, when I learn a new topic or even while reading a non-fiction book, I like to keep written notes as it helps me retain the information much more effortlessly. I think this quote says it all :)

> Come to the book as you would come to an unexplored land. Come without a map. Explore it and draw your own map. - Stephen King

In this blog post, I would like to **share my notes as I go through the course**. 

The notes are written using the [notability](https://notability.com) app. Using digital notebooks enables me to create notes more quickly than with pencil and paper (not to mention the editing possibilities). An even better feature is that I can share them in my blog.

## My approach to learning this course

0. prepare for learning
    - check out the components of the video lecture and the corresponding book chapter
    - read the questions at the end of the chapter
1. listen to the video lecture  
    - write notes and questions as they arise
    - pause the video and run the code 
        - write detailed comments in the code for future self
2. read the corresponding chapter in the book
    - read the chapter
        - highlight and write notes in the margins
        - mark questions and unclear passages with a small yellow post-it notes
            - try to answer the questions by doing further research
    - update and improve the code from the video lecture if needed.
    - go through the chapter again focusing on highlighted text and try to connect the information flow
3. answer the questions at the end of the chapter
    - if anything is unlcear, go back to the text and try to understand what is the unclear part - research further if still unclear
4. write visual notes for the chapter(s)
5. print the written notes and reread them
6. try to explain to someone else, or your computer ;), what you have learned

When highlighting the text in the book, it helps me to have a structured way of doing this. What I mean by this is that instead of just using one color scheme for anything I think is important, I use 5 different colors (light pastel highlighter not to obscure the text a lot):

- yellow: generally important
- orange: very important
- pink/purple: definition/theorem/etc
- green: code
- blue: references mentioned which should be read afterwards

This way, when you skim through the text you will, visually, know exactly what's on each page, making things easier to find.
